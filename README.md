 In 2022, I completed my undergraduate education, earning a Bachelor of Financial Economics from Methodist University. Currently I am a first year MSBA candidate at Brandeis International Business School.  My professional background involves a one-year tenure as a Senior Analyst at a consulting firm and an internship as business consultant.
